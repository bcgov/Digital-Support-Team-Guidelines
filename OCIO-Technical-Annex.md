# OCIO Technical Annex
> July 2020 DRAFT

## Background

* This OCIO Technical Annex supports the Government of BC in adopting a coherent, enterprise approach to funding and governing technology. The OCIO has been directed to sign off from an enterprise architecture perspective on operating and capital expenditures for information technology funding requests. 

* Efforts from the OCIO to enhance practices around funding technology align with government’s commitment to “restore public services and make opportunities available to everyone” while delivering on the promise of digital government.


## Purpose of tht Technical Annex

* The OCIO Technical Annex (May 2020 draft) is intended to serve as a prototype. It could, in the future, support an updated digital investment model for government.

* The Annex is designed to help implement government’s policy on IM and IT ([CPPM Chapter 12](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/policies-for-government/core-policy/policies/im-it-management)), [the Digital Principles](https://github.com/bcgov/Digital-Principles), and [the Service Standard (draft)](https://github.com/rumoncarter/Service-Standard).

* The content here is in part inspired by governance built around the Government of Canada’s Enterprise Architecture Review Board and the UK Spend Control Assessment Criteria. OCIO aims to align with global best practices in funding technology.

## PROBLEM DEFINITION
### Are you solving the right problem?

* Who are your users? What problem are you working to solve for your users?
* Describe the service design work you have undertaken to validate that you are addressing the correct user needs. How you will engage users to collect feedback as you build and deliver your solution?
* How do your users address the problem today? Identify at least 3 efficiencies and improvements to service experiences from the proposed investment. What is the risk of doing nothing?


## PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT
### What are you building or implementing?

* Describe the solution that you would like to implement. Please be specific about the software solutions and standards that you expect to apply.

* Explain the expected impact of implementing the solution.

* Explain the investment will be one-way door or two-way door. (One-way door: Investments from which you don’t have ability to turn around or exist plan. For example, vendor contracts that bind for upfront licensing cost and binds for lock-in. Two-Way door: Investment decisions that enable you to pivot or provide safe exit from the major impact on investment.)


## PRODUCT STRATEGY
### Are you approaching the initiative in the right way?

* **Agile delivery** – What are the phases of your work? Describe your alignment with phases (e.g., Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live) to ensure you are learning and course correcting throughout the process.

* **Team** - Describe your cross-functional team. Explain why you believe that you have sufficient in-house expertise to deliver continuous improvements (i.e., not relying on contracted resources).

* **Decision-making** - How you are approaching your technical architecture decisions? Describe how your solution is scalable and interoperable (i.e., decoupled vs monolithic architecture).

* **Data** - Describe the sources of authoritative data for your solution (e.g., Pharmanet data). Explain your strategy for data quality, integration and sharing. Indicate any relevant data standards.

* **Options** - Demonstrate how you have defined needs in a technology agnostic way.

* **Risks** - Describe the due diligence activities you have considered and anticipated for your solution with regards to financial, personal, or otherwise sensitive information (e.g. FRCR, PIA, STRA).  Explain how any of these due diligence steps pose a barrier to the success of your initiative. List any unmitigated risks that remain for the investment.

## PRODUCT ALIGNMENT
### Does your investment support service excellence across the Government of BC?

* **Strategy** - How you are considering the Province’s strategic direction for digital government? Describe alignment with the Digital Principles, the Digital Framework or Ministry strategies.

* **Enterprise solutions** - Describe the environmental scan you performed across government to see if this problem has already been solved in a relevant way.

* **Open** - Describe which open source software you are considering for your solution. Include a link to any relevant repositories (e.g., GitHub). Describe any web standards you are working to align with. Explain how your solution will support your Ministry’s approach to open data.

## KEY RESULTS
### How will you know that you’re on track?

* How will you know if the investment is successful? Provide at least one quantitative indicator that would allow you to track progress (e.g., user satisfaction, cost per transaction). Focus your metrics on user experience to the extent possible.

* Describe your data collection strategy to measure progress against the indicator.

* Provide a target for progress against the indicator, specifying the timeframe (e.g., 30% improvement in user satisfaction within 1 year).

* If you are seeking approval for a beta or live phase, please provide insight into any results indicators measured to date.
